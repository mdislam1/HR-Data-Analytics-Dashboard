# HR-Data-Analytics-Dashboard
* Built a Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to automate HR processes for AtliQ Technologies.
* Analyzed employee working preferences between Work From Home and Work From Office, overall sick leave percentage, and reasons for frequent work from home to provide valuable insights to HR.
* Developed KPIs using DAX, including Presence %, Work From Home %, Sick Leave %, Present Days, WFH Count, and SL Count, to monitor employee wellness and performance.
* Created an Area Chart visualization to display Presence %, WFH %, and SL % by date, providing a clear and concise overview of employee activity.
